This repository contains codes from my recent project on "Calculator".

This calculator is built using React and TypeScript, which provides a better user experience with a modern web interface.

                                                              
                                                              
                                                I've created a professional calculator with the following features:

1. Basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /)
2. Scientific functions (sin, cos, tan, square root, power)
3. Memory functions (MS, MR, MC)
4. Calculation history with clear option
4. Keyboard support for numbers and basic operations
                                                              
                                                              
6. Beautiful UI with:
-> Gradient background
-> Modern design with shadows and rounded corners
-> Responsive layout
-> Hover effects
-> Clear visual hierarchy


7. Error handling and input validation
8. Clear and CE functions
9. Decimal point support
